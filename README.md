A salon landing pag

I created sketched prototype in Figma and also looked at a similar page for inspiration on structure. Then I decided on font-family. I used the learning material as reference for basic coding. Then I researched or some added features I wanted such as: map, model full screen, adjusting image. I spend some time to review and understand git and set up GitHub.
I still don’t know how to look at other’s work on GitHub and the version control thing

I did not add a carousal because I think booking is most important for people visiting the salon page, so I set it up first thing on the page. I changed the navigation to same page, since I don’t think another page is necessary.

I am still struggling with resizing the image, I want to be able to crop them, since image are different in orientation or size. I want to add a waitlist feature, but not sure if that’s cable with js. The date time picker will also be javascript. I think this landing page is too simple. Any ideas for add on feature?
